# freecodecamp-with-minimum-effort

Hi! I created this GitHub repository to share all the Free Code Camp certification projects I’ve completed with minimal effort—just enough to meet the requirements and earn the certifications. While the code isn’t exemplary, it’s functional and can help anyone looking to quickly complete their own certification projects. I also made this for myself as a way to stay motivated and work toward completing all the certifications.
